### sooner than few weeks

> decoy: Is DickRekt considered a term of endearment or criticism of the project?  I'm new here.\
> sumiflow: the answer is yes\
> solar: it's context specific\
> sumiflow: the term "DickRed" came from a bad korean translation on upbit\
> sumiflow: somehow later it transformed to DickRekt\
> decoy: ahh thx\
> davecgh: Yeah, as noted, it came from a bad Korean translation.  As far as the implications behind it, it really depends on who is using the term.  Most people use it as a term of endearment, but there are a few who don't seem to have anything better to do than find something to complain about, just like with everything else.  You'll notice who is who within a few weeks.\
> mike.rutch: It turned into DickRekt when the price was smashed down to like 0.0025\
> mike.rutch: Because it was Rekt

### not overly scammy

> I’m supportive of Decred’s efforts to add privacy, because there are actual development chops there, and Decred doesn’t appear overly scammy. ([@fluffypony](https://twitter.com/fluffypony/status/979983827643838464))
