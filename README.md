### DCR is very bad

> jazzah: it may just be that "they" discover that DCR is very bad, very bad indeed. First a huge spike off phoney bad market manipulation volume on OOOBTC, then a listing on that awful an dangerous exchange Upbit (Hence why its being raided today). And now in a couple of weeks, the Chinese Minstery is gonna find out that DCR is in fact nothing but a malicious copy of Hshares.

### sooner than few weeks

> decoy: Is DickRekt considered a term of endearment or criticism of the project?  I'm new here.  
> sumiflow: the answer is yes  
> solar: it's context specific  
> sumiflow: the term "DickRed" came from a bad korean translation on upbit  
> sumiflow: somehow later it transformed to DickRekt  
> decoy: ahh thx  
> davecgh: Yeah, as noted, it came from a bad Korean translation.  As far as the implications behind it, it really depends on who is using the term.  Most people use it as a term of endearment, but there are a few who don't seem to have anything better to do than find something to complain about, just like with everything else.  You'll notice who is who within a few weeks.  
> mike.rutch: It turned into DickRekt when the price was smashed down to like 0.0025  
> mike.rutch: Because it was Rekt
